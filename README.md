# reimagined-eureka
A homemade blockchain currency inspired by [crankycoin](https://github.com/cranklin/crankycoin/). I just made this to learn more about how cryptocurrency works and how it is implemented in code, so I never finished its node and client framework since I wouldn't consider strictly a part of the blockchain, but more like a method to make the blockchains interconnected (I could still use this as a working blockchain at my local computer, but would lack the functionality to mine blocks or broadcast/receive transactions made by other users coz there wouldn't be any).

To get this project working, you need to setup MongoDB in your local environment (I preferred to learn MongoDB over SQL due to a number of reasons well summarized by Michael Kennedy in his [MongoDB for Developers](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/mongodb-for-python-for-developers-featuring-orm-odm-mongoengine) course). Before running the code, you need to open up your terminal and type in `mongod` or `sudo mongod` depending on...stuff in your computer. Make sure to check the `requirements.txt` file as well.

_PS:_ the code I used for digital signatures and hashing is from my [glowing-robot](https://github.com/GoddardGuryon/glowing-robot) repository, so make sure to check it out if you're interested to know how it works :)
