# reimagined-eureka
A homemade blockchain currency inspired by [crankycoin](https://github.com/cranklin/crankycoin/). I just made this to learn more about how cryptocurrency works and how it is implemented in code, so I never finished its node and client framework since I wouldn't consider strictly a part of the blockchain, but more like a method to make the blockchains interconnected (I could still use this as a working blockchain at my local computer, but would lack the functionality to mine blocks or broadcast/receive transactions made by other users coz there wouldn't be any)...actually, now I realize that I never even actually tested this code XD

To get this project working, you need to setup MongoDB in your local environment (I preferred to learn MongoDB over SQL due to a number of reasons well summarized by Michael Kennedy in his [MongoDB for Developers](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/mongodb-for-python-for-developers-featuring-orm-odm-mongoengine) course). Before running the code, you need to open up your terminal and type in `mongod` or `sudo mongod` depending on...stuff in your computer.

If you find any error in this code, please make a new issue and let me know what it is and how I can fix it. If you have any suggestions, you could try creating a new issue and see if I'm interested/experienced enough to implement it. If you want to use this code to create your own blockchain, **Think Again**. I had no intention to make a blockchain that could actually be functional in the real world, so I never focussed on its efficiency and security (and a lot of other) facets. If you really want to use the code here in your own project, I highly recommend heading to crankycoin repository instead (although it isn't as much documented as this, but documentation is all I have here).

_PS:_ the code I used for digital signatures and hashing is from my [glowing-robot](https://github.com/GoddardGuryon/glowing-robot) repository, so make sure to check it out if you're interested to know how it works :)
